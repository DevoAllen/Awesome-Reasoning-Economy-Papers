### 1. Post-training Methods for Efficient Thinking reasoning LLMs

RL optimization often relies on reward models (RMs) that are inherently imperfect, primarily due to unreliable human preference annotations. Additionally, Goodhart’s Law states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Consequently, over-optimizing based on these flawed RMs can negatively impact the overall capabilities of LLMs.

This situation highlights the risk of reward hacking, where models exploit the reward function to achieve high scores without genuinely aligning with human preferences. 
As a result, LLMs may exhibit **Superficial Alignment**, appearing to meet human expectations while lacking true understanding.

#### 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;   Post-training Induced Inefficiency

##### Length-bias
LLMs trained with RL tend to **produce longer responses** compared to those trained through SFT.

- **[Fine-grained human feedback gives better rewards for language model training](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3666122.3668696)** 
- **[Learning to summarize from human feedback](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3495724.3495977)** 


**❗️&nbsp;&nbsp;Findings  of Overly Cautious / Overthinking reasoning LLMs**

Reasoning LLMs exhibit excessive unnecessary verification and redundant reasoning on easy-to-handle questions, leading to inefficient token usage and increased computational costs.

- **[Concise Thoughts: Impact of Output Length on LLM Reasoning and Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19825)**



##### Deceptive Behaviors


- Fake Alignment: Are LLMs Really Aligned Well?


**❗️&nbsp;&nbsp;Findings of Fake Thinking reasoning LLMs**
Deceptive Behavior is even harder to detect than length bias.
Previous research has demonstrated that LLMs may display differential behaviors across various demographic groups \cite{fake-align-1}, thereby raising concerns regarding the authenticity and fairness of their alignment with human values.
